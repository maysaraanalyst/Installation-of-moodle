README: Moodle Installation Script for AlmaLinux

This script automates the installation of Moodle, a popular open-source learning platform, on AlmaLinux using Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP.

Requirements:

AlmaLinux system with root privileges 

Installation:

Download the script: 

Bash

wget https://github.com/maysaraanalyst/Installation-of-moodle-/blob/main/install.moodle.almalinux.sh

Make the script executable: 

Bash

chmod +x Install.moodle.almalinux.sh 

Run the script: 

Bash

./install.moodle.almalinux.sh 

Configuration:

The script prompts you to enter a strong password for the Moodle database user. Update the moodle.conf file in /etc/nginx/conf.d/ to replace your_domain with your actual domain name. 

Post-Installation:

Open a web browser and navigate to http://your_domain to complete the Moodle installation process. You'll need to provide the database details created during the script execution. 

Additional Notes:

This script provides a basic installation framework. Refer to the official Moodle documentation (https://download.moodle.org/) for further configuration options and security best practices. Consider creating backups of your system and database before running the script. 

Security:

Use a strong password for the Moodle database user. Regularly update Moodle, Nginx, MariaDB, and PHP to address security vulnerabilities. Implement additional security measures based on your specific environment.
